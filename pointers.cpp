    /// where does it seem like x and the array are located in memory with respect to each other?

    /// In fact, we can INTENTIONALLY set up a variable to hold a memory address.
    /// This is called a POINTER   (it 'points' at the first byte of a variable's space in memory)
    /// Format is data_type* variable_name
    int* xptr;  /// so xptr is a variable that 'points' at an int variable 
    /// int* is the data type int-pointer (or pointer-to-int)

    /// now lets assign the address of x to the pointer variable xptr
    xptr = &x;
    /// what's inside xp?

    /// let's try to make xptr point at y instead of at x

    //double* yptr = &y;
    // cout << "Here is the value of y: " << y << endl;
    // cout << "Here is the address of y: " << &y << endl;
    // cout << "Here is the value of yptr:  " << yptr << endl;

    /// **** declare a char variable, then make a pointer to that variable & print out the value of the variable and its pointer
    /// *** do the same for a string, a float, and a bool variable

    /// we can also see what DATA is contained in the variable whose address the pointer points at
    /// we do this by DEFERENCING the pointer (with an indirection operator):
    /// format is *pointer_name
    //cout << "yptr points to the address of y, and the variable y CONTAINS: " << *yptr << endl;

    /// ****** write similar code to DEREFERENCE one of your pointers

    /// a function can accept and return pointers as well:
    /// to call the addToInt() function, we need to send the ADDRESS of the variable we want to add to
    // cout << "x before the func: " << x << endl;
    //addToInt(xptr);
    //cout << "x after the func: " << x << endl;

    /// ***** write a similar function to change a different data type through a pointer parameter
